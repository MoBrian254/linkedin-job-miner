It constructs a URL based on a given query, retrieves the HTML content, and parses it to extract details like job title, company, location, and job link. 
The extracted information is then organized into a list of dictionaries. 

Finally, the script writes this data to a JSON file, providing a basic foundation for scraping LinkedIn job details for further analysis.
